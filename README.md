# To_Do_List-
Version 1- Work list is also there. You can visit using http://localhost:3000/work. No database is used so if you restart the server data will be lost.

Version 2- If you want to create a new list with a custom name you can create using Version 2. Just append /your_custom_list_name with base url and your list will be created. You can access it again using same url.

For ex- Type http://localhost:3000/grocery a list with name grocery will be created and you can add items there.
